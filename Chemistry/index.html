                <p>
                    Start your journey in learning Chemistry and Science in general with this website. Throughout your
                    journey here in this website, you will learn the true essence of chemistry, science, and learning in
                    general, and why is it wonderful to learn and solve problems. Speaking of solving problems, throughout
                    your journey, you will also gain knowledge and skills through solving basic problems to advance and
                    applied ones, so you can gain knowledge and skills that matters. This website will make learning better
                    and fulfilling while building your skills and knowledge on the way, it's a double advantage of this
                    website.

                <h2>What is Chemistry?</h2>
                <p>
                    <em>Chemistry</em> is the study of matter, its interaction and phenomenon. <strong>Chemistry is the central
                    science</strong> as it is applied to most fields like in medicine, biology, anatomy and physiology, electrical
                    engineering, and many more that deals with matter, which is almost basically everything.</p>
                <p>
                    Because of its application in our world, it is important to learn chemistry as it is a foundation and prerequisite
                    for most fields. The hard truth here is that <em><strong>chemistry is hard</strong></em> however, this should
                    actually make chemistry more exciting to learn and solve more than boring and stressful because you will be
                    pushed outside your comfort zone and make you a better person than you are before.

                <h2>The Big Picture: The outline of chemistry</h2>
                <p>The first bits of this website would be concerned with <em>General Chemistry</em>, which introduces the basic ideas and concepts
                of chemistry. <strong>Basic understanding of chemistry is essential</strong> to tackle more advance concepts and topics like
                Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, Biochemistry, biology, etc.</p>
                <p>This would be the outline of Chemistry:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p><em>General Chemistry</em> deals with the basic concepts of chemistry and skills such as stoichiometry, basic quantum mechanics and physics of atoms, thermodynamics, behavior of electrons, types of bonds</p></li>
                    <li><p><em>Organic Chemistry</em> deals with lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Veniam maiores harum consectetur! Labore nobis, ipsum assumenda quasi dolorem commodi explicabo impedit reiciendis eveniet perferendis! Quam delectus aliquid molestiae repellendus earum.</p> </li>
                    <li><p><em>Inorganic Chemistry</em> deals with the interactions and behavior of mainly metalloids</p></li>
