                <dd>An atom is the smallest particle of an element</dd>
                <dt>Element</dt>
                <dd>An element is the purest form of a matter, each element consist of different numbers of protons.</dd>
                <dt>Molecule</dt>
                <dd>Molecules are matter composed of two or more atoms, it usually have unique properties distinct from the
                    atoms it's composed of.</dd>
                <dd>Note that I said molecules are composed of more than one <em>atoms</em>, not elements, which brings us to:
                </dd>
                <dt>Compound</dt>
                <dd>Compounds are molecules comprised of more than one <em>elements</em></dd>

    <h1>[Temporary] Laws, Theory, Models, and the Scientific Methods</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>Laws</dt>
        <dd>Laws are generalization and simplification of a phenomenon, commonly expressed in a single equation.</dd>

        <dt>Theory</dt>
        <dd>Theory is an explanation for the observed phenomenon that's a general truth, it brings out many hypothesis and evidences</dd>

        <dt>Models</dt>
        <dd>Models are representation of an object or phenomenon that's very hard or impossible to observe, however, it
            offers some issues and limitations.</dd>

        <dt>The Scientific Method</dt>
        <dd>It's a common and standard method for scientist to learn and discover the general truth about the universe.
        </dd>
        <dd>The scientific method are executed as follows:
            <ol>
                <li>Observation of phenomenon</li>
                <li>
                    Formulating a hypothesis
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hypothesis is often confused with theory or used interchangeably, which is not true.
                            <strong>Hypothesis</strong> is the prediction or assumption of something based on
                            observation and theories and laws, while <strong>Theory</strong> is an explanation of
                            something, often complex phenomenon, it's backed-up by experiments and evidences just like
                            Laws</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Testing and Experimenting the Hypothesis</li>
                <li>If results contradict with the hypothesis, further observation required</li>
                <li>IF results aligned with the hypothesis, the hypothesis become either a Law or a Theory</li>
            </ol>
        </dd>
    </dl>
