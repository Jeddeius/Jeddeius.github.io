                <h3 id="s2-1">My Beliefs</h3>
                <p>In this world with endless problems, we despise solving problems because of human nature, we seek
                    for
                    comfort rather than hardship. However, it came to my reflection and realization that the
                    perception
                    of the society towards problem and solving them has lead to a gradual progression of depression,
                    apathy, and narrow source of happiness for the majority of the population. But the true beauty
                    of
                    life comes down to solving endless problems. Without problems, life as we know it, would be
                    purposeless, the world, proven by physics, the world and our lives will always contain
                    inequality,
                    if life doesn't have problem, then everything is condense into one, everything is one and equal,
                    which violates the phenomenon. Despising problem and solving them would only lead to pain,
                    suffering, and death. Our happiness will be limited to results and solve problems, which is
                    never
                    the case, we should live the moment of solving the problem, feel the moment and experience, and
                    enjoy the process, and that is life, it's about enjoying the process, not just the product of
                    it,
                    but this process should sustain itself, maintain and improve itself, and that's the essence of
                    problem solving, in solving problem, we gain more strength and time to continue solving these
                    endless problems til exhaustion or death.</p>
                <p
                    style="border-left: 5px #ff0000 solid; padding-left: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; background-color: #ff00001c;">
                    This concept is very hard to grasp and understand, even I don't fully understand it, but It's in
                    my
                    head, waiting to be shared with others, so that humanity will live not in depression and
                    desperation, but with prosperity and happiness. I'm still finding ways to refine it, so that I
                    can
                    explain it to my fellow humans what did I discovered and reflected upon</p>
                <p>
                    There are many people, chasing for happiness, thinking it is something that is achieved, but
                    happiness is rather experienced, and to continue experience it, it should sustain itself. I want
                    people to experience the realization and revelation I reflected upon. In solving problem, I gain
                    strength to solve problems further, and when this cycle repeats, then there is life, because
                    it's
                    continuos and shows lack of entropy, and when we live in the moment, the experience, the process
                    of
                    solving problems, then we become happy, content, and fulfilled. This is life the world desire so
                    much! And ladies and gentlemen, I think I figure out the essence of life!
                </p>
                <p>This is just the tip of the iceberg!</p>

            <div class="casualDiv">
                <h3 id="s2-2">My Vision</h3>
                <p>I desire a life where I do what I love that contributes to the continuation of humanity and life
                    itself and prosperity of the humanity, in a very broad term, solving endless problem till death.
                    Breaking it down, I want to create things that contributes to overall goodness of humanity,
                    learn
                    and discover things, and teach them to the world. Earn and improve various skills and knowledge.
                    Create relationships and connections, why? I can't deny that I'm a human, a very social
                    creature.
                    With the knowledge and skills I gained, I want to solve various problems that matter to the
                    world
                    and also to contribute to solving a massive problem, because even a small contribution is a part
                    of
                    an overall force or mass. I want to be a well rounded person</p>
                <p>I kind of want to be a father of preferably fraternal twins</p>

                    personality over an efficient but reasonable amount of time. Become a functioning member of the
